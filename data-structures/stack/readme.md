# Stacks
Stacks are a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Hence, if we insert `n` elements in increasing order, i.e., `a1, a2, ..., an`, they must be extracted from the stack in the reversed order: `an, ..., a2, a1`.

## Operations

- **push:** O(1);
- **pop:** O(1);
- **top:** O(1);
- **size:** O(1);
- **empty:** O(1);
- **print:** iterate through all elements, printing them, thus O(n).
