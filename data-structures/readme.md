# Data Structures
As a first and essential exercise, the study of data structures allows the programmer to rightly use them along problems and their further solutions. Yet, such analysis allows us to know some important computational limitations and aids our algorithm analysis process.

Many of the following structures were taken from the C++ standard library and *Cormen et. Al* book, *Introduction to Algorithms*.
